Wednesday 15th May
I came up with an idea for a game.

the name is a play on the game Hair-NAH
and the methods and techniques are inspired by the faboulous Franks Labratory

# Hair Yeahhhhh
JS Snake like game centred around growing hair and hair care with a positive message throughout 

Grow hair with - fruit, water
Boost hair with - heat, but too much causes damage!

Shorten hair with - scissors, something dry, fast food, trampling over your own length

At the end of a time limit, showcase your hair in a pretty image
